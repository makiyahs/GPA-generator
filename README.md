In the GPA generator you can first use a drop down box to list the number of classes you're in. Once you list them, the number of boxes that correlates with the number will appear. Then once they appear you're able to type in the grade you have in each class. Then by using these grades the program converts the grades into numbers and then calculate your GPA by adding each grade together and then by dividing the number by the nmber of classes you have. Then your GPA will appear once you hit the go button and type in your letter grades.
